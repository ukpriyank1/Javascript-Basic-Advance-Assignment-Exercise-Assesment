        // JavaScript Events to do all examples?

        // 1. HTML/Inline Event Handlers
        
       /*  You should be aware of this dangerous behavior because older browsers still use it. This approach is no longer used because it is always preferable to keep JavaScript and HTML separate. */ 
        
        /* The value of the attribute, whose name corresponds to the names of the events, calls the associated function. The following syntax can be used to identify an HTML event handler: */

        // <element attribute = “functionName()”>

            // Code:

            function changeColor(){
                document.querySelector("button").style.backgroundColor = "blue"; //change background color
                document.querySelector("button").style.color = "white"; //change font color
                document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Great! The button changed its color." //add text
              }

    //  2. Standard DOM Event Handlers
    
            /* The original specification for the DOM introduced DOM event handlers as a substitute for adding an event handler to any element. This approach is favored over inline event handlers because it removes JavaScript from the HTML. This strategy is supported by all popular browsers. The disadvantage is that you can only connect one function to any event. As a result, one or both of the scripts may not function as intended if a page utilizes multiple scripts and they each respond to the same event.*/

            // Learn more about JavaScript DOM with our tutorial.
            
            // The syntax for adding an event is as follows:

            //  element.onevent = functionName;

            /* Have you noticed that we left the function name's parenthesis off? This is due to the fact that a function's name followed by a parenthesis instructs the interpreter to "run this code now" when the function is invoked. Only when the event fires, as desired, should the function run.  */

            /* The output is produced using conventional DOM handlers by the JavaScript code, which is displayed below. */

            // Code:

            var btn = document.querySelector("button");
            function changeColor(){
              btn.style.backgroundColor = "blue"; //change background color
              btn.style.color = "white"; //change font color
              document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Great! The button changed its color." //add text
            }
            btn.onclick = changeColor; //event handler


    // 3. The functions addEventListener and removeEventListener
            
            /* These were added via a DOM update (DOM level 2, in 2000) as the preferred method of adding an event handler. These enable a single event to activate several functions, in contrast to conventional DOM event handlers. As a result, there are less conflicts between the several scripts running on the same page. With IE8 or earlier versions of IE, this method is ineffective. Using jQuery, these disparities in browser support can be overcome. */
            
            
            // The following syntax can be used to add an event listener to your event:

                 // 1. element.addEventListener(“event”, functionName [, Boolean]);
            
            // Or you can remove the event listener by using the syntax below:
             
                 // element.removeEventListener(“event”, functionName [, Boolean]);

            /*  For event capturing, the Boolean value is often set to false. If you want to alter the event flow, you can set the value to true. */

             /*  The code that follows demonstrates how to utilize this strategy to achieve our desired result (adding an event listener). */

            //  Code:

            var btn = document.querySelector("button");
            function changeColor(){
              btn.style.backgroundColor = "blue"; //change background color
              btn.style.color = "white"; //change font color
              document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Great! The button changed its color." //add text
            }
            btn.addEventListener("click", changeColor); //adds event listener


            // Use the following code to remove the event listener from your event:

                // 1. btn.removeEventListener(“click, changeColor”);


    // 4. Event handlers and listeners when using parameters

             /* There may be times when you require a function to work with parameters when programming. This way of adding an event does not provide us that option. We employ anonymous functions, or functions without a name, to fix this. */ 

             /* The code executes immediately since parenthesis come after the function call (to pass the arguments). To ensure that the function call only executes when the event initiates it, we enclose it in an anonymous function. This strategy's syntax is as follows: */ 

             //  1. element.addEventListener(“event”, function(){ functionCall(parameters); }, Boolean);

             // The task we were solving using the aforementioned ways doesn't require any parameters, but we will still use this method in order to comprehend how the code functions.

             // Code:
             var btn = document.querySelector("button");
             function changeColor(anyParameter){ //function declaration
               btn.style.backgroundColor = "blue"; //change background color
               btn.style.color = "white"; //change font color
               document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "Great! The button changed its color." //add text
             }
             btn.addEventListener("click", function(){
               changeColor(1); //function with a parameter
             }, false); //adds event listener with anonymous function


             // Flow of JavaScript Events

                // Although this subject is uncommon, if you don't grasp it, it could really harm your code. A situation may operate in one of two ways:

                       // Event Spiking 
                      // Event Taking

                // Knowing these processes will make it easier to understand what happens when event handlers are turned on for an element.

                // Why the event flow matters?

                // Only when the code has event handlers on both an element and one of its ancestor/descendant elements does the order of events actually matter. The capturing phase is set if the Boolean value is true; if false, the bubbling phase is set.



                // The Event Bubble
                     /* From the most specific node to the least specific node, the event spreads outward.*/

                // Event Recording
                     /* From the least to the most specific node, the event travels inward. */
