        // A promise is a useful tool for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It is used to determine whether or not the asynchronous operation was successful.

       // One of three statuses are possible for a promise.



       // Pending

       // Fulfilled

       // Rejected

       /*A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. If the operation is successful, the process ends in a fulfilled state. And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.*/

      /* For example, when you request data from the server by using a promise, it will be in a pending state. When the data arrives successfully, it will be in a fulfilled state. If an error occurs, then it will be in a rejected state. */

      /* Establish a Promise
          We employ the Promise() constructor to produce a promise object.
       */

//        let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
//      //do something
// });

/* An argument is a function that is passed to the Promise() constructor. Additionally, the functions reject() and resolve() are accepted. */

/* The resolve() method is called if the promise is successfully fulfilled. Additionally, the reject() function is used if there is a mistake. */
