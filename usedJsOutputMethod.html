        //  In JavaScript, there are four different ways to show output.
       
           //  1. using the window.alert() alert box.
           //  2. making use of document.write().
           //  3. using innerHTML to modify the inner HTML.
          //   4. using console.log() on the browser's console.

          // 1. Using window.alert()

                 /* With this technique, a text-filled alert box will be displayed, along with an OK button beneath the text. The user will receive any vital information via an alert box. It is triggered by a certain event, and the webpage is rendered inoperable until the alert box is displayed on top of the webpage.
                  */
                  window.alert(8 + 4); // 12

          // 2. Output from JavaScript the document.write() method

                 /*  This technique displays the output within the body of the text and is used for testing. The content that falls under the purview of the page's body is typically shown.  */
                 document.write(8 + 4);  // 12

          // 3. Output from JavaScript Using innerHTML

                 /* JavaScript can use the document to access any element with a specified ID.The CSS/HTML of the chosen element can then be updated by using the innerHTML property in conjunction with the getElementById(id) method. This feature makes it possible to make modifications even after the webpage has fully loaded.  */

                 /* The innerHTML property defines the HTML content, while the id attribute chooses the HTML element with that specific id:  */

                 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;  // 11

          // 4. Output from JavaScript: console.log

                /*  The output will be displayed in the browser's console section. The console area provides information on different website-related issues and alerts. To view the output shown within the console, just pick "console" from the debugger menu by pressing the F12 key. */

                console.log(8 + 4); // 12
