        // What is JSON
        // Javascript Object Notation is referred to as JSON. A text-based data format called JSON is used to store and send data. 
        // The data in JSON is organized into key/value pairs and separated by commas.
        // JSON is a descendant of JavaScript. Consequently, the JSON syntax is similar to the JavaScript object literal syntax. However, other computer languages can also access and create the JSON format.

        // JSON syntax
      /*  {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 22,
            "gender": "male"
        }
